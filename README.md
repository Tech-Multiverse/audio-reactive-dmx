## Unreal Engine Project
The UE 5.5.0 project files are in the "Audio_Reactive_DMX_UE5_project" folder.  

This contains two rows of moving head lights that are set-up to listen for DMX data coming from localhost.

## TouchDesigner Project
The TouchDesigner project files that take audio input (from my DJ Controller) and convert that to DMX data are located in the "TD" folder.

You can alter this project to use any input you like.    

**See project resources above for how I set everything up.**
